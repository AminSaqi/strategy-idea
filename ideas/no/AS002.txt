=============================

* Trade Idea:
When MACD histogram is positive on trending instruments, tt seems that entering long when close price breaks up the 5-days high, and exiting long when close breaks down the 7-days low, can be profitable.

When MACD histogram is positive and close price breaks up through the 5-days high, It's time to enter long. 
When MACD histogram becomes negative or close price breaks down through the 7-days low, It's time to exit long. 
Otherwise, we hold the previous position.

=============================

* Buy conditions
	b1: MACD histogram is positive.
	b2: close is greater than highest(5).

=============================

* Sell conditions
	s1: MACD histogram is negative.
	s2: close is less than lowest(7).

=============================

* Trade Logic
	Buy IF 	(b1 AND b2)
	Sell IF (s1 or s2)
